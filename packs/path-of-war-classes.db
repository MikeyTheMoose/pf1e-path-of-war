{"name":"Mystic","type":"class","img":"icons/magic/perception/orb-crystal-ball-scrying-blue.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Born with an untamed magical power buried deep within his soul, the mystic is a warrior who, much like a sorcerer, is filled with untapped energies. This power however, is too primal and unstable, and is difficult to be formed effectively into a spell. By following a martial medium to tame this energy, the mystic is able to shape his wild power into martial maneuvers and this allows him to discover the deeper mysteries of his own inborn power.</p>\n<p>Adventures: Most mystics adventure to stretch the limits of their powers, learning to master the mysteries within their souls. Some do it to express their power in ways that suit their ethics, for good or for ill, and others travel to find others like themselves, to study and train with and hope to eventually learn more about why they are the way they are.</p>\n<p>Characteristics: Mystics tend to be a very introspective lot, wielding a power so foreign to most with an intuitive sense of understanding. Many mystics follow ascetic lifestyles, hoping that the order and abstaining of life&rsquo;s vices will help them control their power. Others embrace their wild energies and move with the moment, pausing to reflect at the end of the day as to what drives their motivations.</p>\n<p>Alignment: Any. Mystics do not follow any ethical or moral path, and choose their own destiny. Some cling to lawful alignments to master their powers, and others embrace chaotic alignments to freely express their talents.</p>\n<p>Religion: Mystics who follow religion often find their faith with gods of battle, nature, magic, or freedom.</p>\n<p>Background: Mystics universally have one thing in common, and that&rsquo;s a magical creature or magic-using being in their near family history. This power is an inherited consequence of such relation, and while it is not widely understood why it has chosen to manifest in such a way, the mystic&rsquo;s wild power is usually an expression of this relation&rsquo;s own power. Mystics are born, and must train to master their energies.</p>\n<p>Races: Any member of any race could be a mystic, provided they had the ancestry and proper training available. Most commonly they are of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human\">human</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf\">elven</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome\">gnome</a>&nbsp;races. Among monster races,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/kobold\">kobolds</a>&nbsp;and their draconic bloodlines are among the first and foremost experts in the realm of mysticism, and many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey\">fey</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Elemental\">elemental</a>&nbsp;blooded creatures as well.</p>\n<p>Other Classes: Mystics tend to chafe with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerers</a>&nbsp;around, as they see each other as failed expressions of the other. Otherwise, mystics find the most in common with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger\">rangers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monks</a>&nbsp;for either their freedom or their discipline. Wizards find them interesting and enjoy studying their powers, and martially inclined characters find them to be steady and useful allies.</p>\n<p>Role: A mystic will often find themselves in the role of both striker and party supporter. The glyphs they manifest will aid themselves and their allies, as their animus builds power and strength. Not as hardy as other warriors, however, mystics will find themselves needing the protection of their more robust allies from time to time.</p>\n<p>Abilities:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;is the primary attribute for the mystic, and this determines factors of their class features, maneuver saving throws, and their animus.

{"name":"Warlord","type":"class","img":"icons/creatures/abilities/mouth-teeth-human.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Dynamos on the field of combat, warlords walk the line of victory and ruin through their determination to achieve glory. Where some may talk tactics, the warlord dives in. Where some may fight in strategic units, the warlord shines alone as an inspirational beacon on the field of combat; to be a warlord is to be a lord of war.</p>\n<p>Adventures: Warlords adventure for many reasons, but one reason that will always be prominent is the desire to test their skill against the world&rsquo;s most dangerous opponents, to show their strength to themselves and to the world. Others may do this for profit, others for fun, others for revenge, but it is always certain that a warlord seeks the glory and honor only a battle well-fought can bring.</p>\n<p>Characteristics: Brash arrogance and an irrepressible nature are hallmarks of the warlord. A devil-may-care warrior, many warlords are as fearless as they are fierce, and they both love life and live their lives to the fullest. Hedonists in some extreme cases, the warlord is drawn to combat as a moth to the flame. Alignment: Any. Warlords can come from any and all ethical backgrounds, though they do tend more towards a chaotic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>. Lawfully aligned warlords are rarer, and tend to compose their impulses through strict discipline.</p>\n<p>Religion: While not overly religious, some warlords follow gods of war and battle with temperaments similar to their own.</p>\n<p>Background: Warlords come from families with strong warrior traditions, from barbaric tribes and from academies that produce the strongest warriors. One thing that sets them apart is their reckless nature and the inspirational presence they possess.</p>\n<p>Races:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human\">Humans</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-elf\">half-elves</a>&nbsp;are prominent warlord races due to both possessing an impetuous nature.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/Half-orc\">Half-orcs</a>&nbsp;become very fearsome warlords in their own right, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarves</a>&nbsp;are known for their ferocity when defending their homes.</p>\n<p>Other Classes: Warlords get on well with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighters</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger\">rangers</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian\">barbarians</a>&nbsp;as their martial nature makes them amicable, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin\">paladins</a>&nbsp;and warders tend to chafe under their recklessness. Wizards and especially&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard\">bards</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerers</a>&nbsp;get on quite well with them, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">clerics</a>&nbsp;find them to be tolerable.</p>\n<p>Role: Striker. As a very aggressive class, the warlord seeks to bring martial power to the field in the form of overwhelming force and ferocity.

gambits.</p>\n<p>Abilities:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a

Their intellect guides them through battle, and their skill at arms achieves their success.</p>\n<p>Adventures: Warders adventure to further their employer&rsquo;s missions, to serve on battlefields as protectors and champions, or to protect those that they care about. Some warders adventure to forge kingdoms of their own, battle tyranny, fight others of their kind for honor, or to live simply and by their own code.</p>\n<p>Characteristics: Warders are always protective of people they deem in their care, be it a superior, their friends, or fellow soldiers of fortune. Many warders are proud, intelligent individuals who study tactics and maps as well while training daily with their associates to better suit their style towards their defense.</p>\n<p>Alignment: Any, but most are lawful; the moral portion of their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;is either up to them or their inclusion in their sect.</p>\n<p>Religion: Many warders are religious, often following gods of war, chivalry, and sacrifice. Some follow gods of tyranny or justice, and others follow gods that stand for the good of their race.</p>\n<p>Background: Warders find their place in their society based upon their line of adventuring. Some warders are regarded with great respect as leaders and guardians while others are feared and hated for their tyrannical ways. Many are respected and treated well in the hopes that if trouble comes, the warder will come to help those who showed them kindness.</p>\n<p>Races: Nearly all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid\">humanoid</a>&nbsp;races have warders amongst them.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">Dwarves</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-orc\">half-orcs</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human\">humans</a>&nbsp;make up the larger majority of warders in more civilized society, but there are a minority of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling\">halflings</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome\">gnomes</a>&nbsp;that guard their kind from harm. While&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf\">elves</a>&nbsp;possess the tactical prowess to make great warders, their fragile bodies are often not enough for the physical rigors of the profession. While some warders are restrictive to whom they&rsquo;ll share their secrets, it&rsquo;s largely agreed that the more monstrous races tend to be excluded. Hobgoblins, of the monstrous races, are by far the largest exception to that stereotype.</p>\n<p>Other Classes: Warders get on well with those of a more orderly and martial bent, naturally befriending&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin\">paladins</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monks</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighters</a>.

Warders are natural guardians and protectors of the weaker members of the party, and are the ones who can take the most damage on the front line. They also double as being coordinators on the battlefield, helping their teammates and providing support for them both defensively and offensively.</p>\n<p>Abilities:&nbsp;<a

{"name":"Harbinger","type":"class","img":"icons/skills/melee/strike-dagger-skull-white.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Like rumors of war or plague-ridden winds, harbingers move through battlefields and leave only ruin and sorrow in their wake. Empowered from within by a deep connection to sorrow, grief, and wrath, harbingers channel their negative emotions into a supernatural fighting style that is strange and terrifying to behold. Some accept the darker urges within themselves but leash them, making their wrath serve as a hound might&mdash; and others embrace the violence within, becoming killers without restraint or pity.</p>\n<p>Adventures: Harbingers adventure for many and sundry reasons, ranging from simple greed to revenge to genuine altruism. Many harbingers learn their trade from a mentor or master who sometimes imparts a mission or task to them, or initiates them into an organization that retains the harbinger as its agent. Harbingers aren&rsquo;t any less likely to take to the adventuring life out of friendship than anyone else and may be found in the company of mercenaries they&rsquo;ve grown to love, or at least no longer feel like they can live without.</p>\n<p>Characteristics: Regardless of their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>, religion, culture of origin, or beliefs, all harbingers have one thing in common: violence. For some anger and sorrow are tools they use to do their jobs, an acknowledgement that all sapients have both good and evil within. For others violence marks and defines their lives, with angry scars and psychological wounds. Some crumble before the anger within, becoming little more than puppets for their hate, and others refuse to give in and display a level of self-control that can only be called saintlike. However, all harbingers live their lives coming to&mdash;or failing to come to&mdash;terms with the darkness within.</p>\n<p>Alignment: Any. Though harbingers are marked by their darker urges they are not utterly defined by them, and many brave and noble souls succeed in staring into the abyss until the abyss averts its gaze. It is true that many Harbingers skew towards evil and/or chaos, but nothing stops a harbinger from turning their power to altruistic ends.</p>\n<p>Religion: Harbingers tend to be on one side or the other of the line between piety and indifference when it comes to religion. Many harbingers that have been scarred by violence or evil shy away from faith, unable to believe that higher powers truly influence their lives. Others embrace gods of violence, vengeance, tyranny or destruction out of a feeling of common sympathy or even obligation. Good-aligned harbingers tend to worship gods of justice or retribution, taking on the role of those who dispense justice to the wicked, or to gravitate towards gods they seek to emulate&mdash;gods of peace, love, or beauty that remind the harbingers of the things they choose to defend.</p>\n<p>Background: At some point in their lives, all harbingers encountered the violence within. Some come from cursed or tainted backgrounds, dragged towards power by fiendish blood or maledictions laid down upon their ancestors. Others have inherent but untapped magical potential that erupts in a moment of wrath or panic, and many harbingers have started on their path with blood dripping from their fingers and a look of shocked panic on their face. Harbingers tend to be from places marked or scarred by strife, and the majority emerge from lands wracked by civil war, military conflict, massive social change, crushing poverty or endemic crime, though this may be because the circumstances that awaken their power are so much more common in such places.</p>\n<p>It is possible to deliberately train a harbinger, though magical potential must be present. Such master-student relationships are less common than &lsquo;wild&rsquo; harbingers but can often end up with an harbinger that understands her own power much better. Some teachers use cruel and sadistic training methods to force their student to confront the anger inside of them, while others ask that their pupils meditate on the nature of evil and its role in the multiverse. Both approaches are effective, and produce very different students.</p>\n<p>Races: Any race capable of feeling anger, sorrow, or grief can potentially become an harbinger. That said, some are certainly more common than others. Savage&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid\">humanoids</a>&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/orc\">orcs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/gnoll\">gnolls</a>&nbsp;produce a large number of harbingers; their day-to-day lives are marked with violence and maliciousness.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human\">Humans</a>&nbsp;and part-humans (but especially&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/tiefling\">tieflings</a>) also make up a large part of harbinger membership, both because of the significant role negative emotions play in their lives and the endemic poverty and crime rates found in their cities. In contrast, races with gentle day-to-day lives such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf\">elves</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarves</a>&nbsp;produce harbingers more rarely, and even then usually as part of a master-student relationship.</p>\n<p>Other Classes: Harbingers can often have difficulty around divinely-empowered classes such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">clerics</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin\">paladins</a>, most often because of the ultimate source of their power. Paladins in particular tend to disapprove of harbingers utilizing evil urges, even for good ends, and the conflicts between the two can run long and deep.</p>\n<p>Role: Control. Harbingers command the battlefield with a combination of superior mobility and debilitating strikes, determining when and how they want to engage and targeting weak enemies while shutting stronger ones out of the battle. Their spread of supernatural maneuvers gives harbingers access to magical and unusual abilities that can shift the tide of battle in their favor.</p>\n<p>Abilities:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;is pivotal to harbingers; it controls the save DCs of their maneuvers and boosts their accuracy and damage.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;helps a harbinger survive the rigors of battle, while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;shore up her defenses.</p>\n<p>Starting Age: Intuitive.</p>\n<p>Starting Wealth: 4d6 &times; 10 gp (average 140 gp.)

A loyal guard lays down his life for his homeland without hesitation. A cultist is driven to greater and greater ecstasies of blood to satisfy the wicked whispers that fill his mind day and night. All believe that if they sacrifice enough for their dreams, even the impossible can be realized. These dreams are enough to shape those around them&mdash;and, if realized&mdash;the world</p>\n<p>Adventures: Zealots live in pursuit of a passion or cause. Each zealot has a purpose they intimately understand, from protecting their country, to spreading their religion, to hunting down every last one of the assassins who murdered their master.</p>\n<p>Characteristics: Zealots typically have intense personalities&mdash;despite their commitment to one cause, if one fire cools, another will ignite. This fervency is what draws in their allies and sets them apart: What some might believe on an intellectual level in a vague, apathetic way, the zealot embraces and knows like a lover.</p>\n<p>Alignment: Any. Zealots have a strict devotion to an ideal that they follow with reckless abandon. While zealots often allow the ends to justify the means, they also put the needs of something greater than themselves beyond their own needs. These conflicting motivations create zealots of every conceivable stripe. Though zealots do not change&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;more frequently than other classes, a zealot who changes alignments fights for his new ideals with the same intensity as the one he left behind.</p>\n<p>Religion: Many zealots are religious, but their personal beliefs often clash with established dogma. Zealots often live at the extremes of a given religion&mdash;its most brutal enforcers, its most devout preachers, its first followers, its greatest defenders, and its most despised heretics. This purity of drive leads zealots to frequently found their own religions, philosophies, and cults.</p>\n<p>Background: Zealots are found most frequently in times of uncertainty and places of conflict, though whether this is because these situations are ideal for creating zealots, zealots are drawn to these areas, or zealots create these situations is uncertain.</p>\n<p>Races: Zealots are most commonly found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human\">humans</a>&nbsp;and other shorter-lived races, because zealots often live short and burn bright. Sadly, there may be just as many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarven</a>&nbsp;patriots as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-goblin\">goblin</a>&nbsp;fanatics, but the dwarves who follow less impassioned lives will typically live much longer ones.

Zealots sometimes clash with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin\">paladins</a>, and others with strong personalities (a natural consequence of too many leaders and not enough followers), but thoughtful classes like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor\">inquisitors</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle\">oracles</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger\">rangers</a>&nbsp;can channel the zealot&rsquo;s ardor against the proper targets. Zealots do not inherently get along well, and there are often zealots on all sides of a conflict.</p>\n<p>Role: Leader. A zealot inspires the hearts and minds of those he fights alongside through pure passion, bringing his allies to heights they never thought possible. With proper feat and maneuver choices, zealots can also become masters of battlefield control.</p>\n<p>Abilities: A zealot relies most heavily on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>, which is his initiation modifier and grants bonus power points to fuel its class features.

{"_id":"h9jC5FVPq0W57Xw1","name":"Stalker","type":"class","img":"All%20Icons/Armor/helmets_5.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>An effective warrior wielding both skill and stealth, the stalker is a martial disciple who battles in the deep shadows and the hidden underworld of night. Through rigorous training and deep, intuitive instincts, the stalker is a trained killer whose very art is considered illegal in some places. Part mystic, part warrior, and part assassin, the stalker&rsquo;s arts are varied, but always deadly.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventures</strong>: Stalkers adventure for many reasons, but most do so either as part of a guild of fellow stalkers on a mission, for money and profit, or for deeper, often darker purposes of the heart. Some adventure for the test of their skill, but this is slightly rarer; whatever the reason, the path of the stalker is often a self-absorbed one.</p>\n<p><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Stalkers universally are very introspective people, they rely so heavily upon their intuitive reactions to situations and their heightened reflexes through athletic skill that they usually have an air of detachment. Some are braggarts, but many are quiet and calm, paying close attention to their surroundings should they need to use their lethal skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any. Stalkers do not lean to any particular&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;trend, running the gamut of all walks of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion</strong>: Some stalkers are deeply religious, finding solace in their meditations to gods of night, death, travels, or revelry. Other stalkers find no use for gods, for if the gods protected and cared for their flock, then they wouldn&rsquo;t make their followers so easy to kill.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong>: Stalkers often arise from the poor and underprivileged who live in city slums, trained from their youth to be unfeeling killers. Others are trained in remote areas in a more monastic fashion, taught to be warriors who strike from the shadows. The training of stalkers can also be an individual thing, each master teaching a student in their own way, the way they were taught.</p>\n<p><strong>Races:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human\">Humans</a>&nbsp;and outcast races tend to be drawn to the path of the stalker.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/Half-orc\">Half-orcs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-elf\">half-elves</a>&nbsp;make up a majority of the non-<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human\">human</a>&nbsp;stalkers, with goblinoids coming in next.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Classes</strong>: Stalkers get on well with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue\">rogues</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger\">rangers</a>&nbsp;due to having complementary roles. Paladins and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">clerics</a>&nbsp;often chafe when partied with stalkers, as their reputation as killers (rightly or wrongly) often sours opinions of them. Other classes generally have a neutral opinion of stalkers, unless that stalker has come for them.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: Striker. In the party, the stalker follows the heavily armored&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;into combat, using them as shields and distractions so they can inflict maximum damage on their foes. In addition, the stalker can serve quite well as the party scout, finding danger and warning the party before they stumble upon it.</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities</strong>:&nbsp;<a

href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;are prime attributes for stalkers, as many of their skills are governed by these abilities and
