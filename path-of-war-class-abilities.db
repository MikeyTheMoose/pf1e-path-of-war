If the roil dancer would gain the ability to ignore&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance\">resistances</a>&nbsp;of that type, he instead ignores an equal amount of damage reduction. If the roil dancer gains a resistance or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Immunity-and-Vulnerability\">immunity</a>&nbsp;to one of these damage types from a maneuver or stance, these still function as normal, reducing damage of that type as appropriate. A roil dancer&rsquo;s resistances or immunities to a physical damage type apply to all attacks that deal that damage type, even ones that are also other types of damage.<br /><br />**Positive energy damage, also used in&nbsp;Psionics Augmented: Seventh Path, deals damage by disrupting the target&rsquo;s body with an influx of pure life.

The maneuvers she chooses remain readied until she decides to meditate again and change them. The mystic does not need to sleep or rest for any long period of time in order to ready her maneuvers; any time she spends ten minutes in meditation, she can change her readied maneuvers.</p>\n<p>A mystic begins an encounter with all her readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times she might have already used them since she chose them.

Because of this, they do not have full control over their readied maneuvers; when a mystic readies her maneuvers, she selects two of her readied maneuvers to be immediately granted to her for use at any time (when these two maneuvers are used outside of combat, they recover on their own in the following round), with the rest of her initially randomized maneuvers waiting to be granted in combat.

By setting himself to danger, does his true skill shine, or so the motto of the warlord goes. At 1st level, a warlord selects two gambits from the gambits available to warlords. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, a warlord selects an additional gambit to learn. Any gambit that would normally use the warlord&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier to determine its effects instead uses his warlord initiation modifier, if it is a different ability. These gambits allow the warlord to recover maneuvers. Due to their reliance on the stresses of combat to bring out the best of the warlord, gambits cannot be used outside combat.</p>\n<p>A gambit has two aspects: a risk and a reward. A gambit&rsquo;s risk describes an action the warlord must take in order to play the gambit. The warlord begin a gambit as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, then performs the gambit&rsquo;s risk action.

Allies who would gain a benefit from the gambit&rsquo;s reward must be within 60 feet of the warlord and able to see him perform the gambit&rsquo;s risk.

A warpath follower must always ready his maximum number of maneuvers readied. He readies his maneuvers by meditating or praying to his deity for ten minutes. The maneuvers he chooses remain readied until he decides to practice again and change them. The warpath follower does not need to sleep or rest for any long period of time in order to ready his maneuvers; any time he spends ten minutes practicing, he can change his readied maneuvers.</p>\n<p>A warpath follower begins an encounter with all his readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times he might have already used them since he chose them. When he initiates a maneuver, he expends it for the current encounter, so each of his readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (unless he recovers them, as described below).</p>\n<p>Unlike other martial disciples, warpath followers rely on flashes of divine inspiration to inform their strategy in combat. Because of this, they do not have full control over their readied maneuvers; when a warpath follower readies his maneuvers, he selects one of his readied maneuvers to be immediately granted to him for use at any time (when this maneuver is used outside of combat, it recovers on its own in the following round), with the rest of his initially randomized maneuvers waiting to be granted in combat. The remainder of his readied maneuvers are withheld and currently inaccessible until combat begins. If he is able to act in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Surprise\">surprise</a>&nbsp;round when combat begins, he is granted his maneuvers then as normal, but if he is caught unaware, he must wait until his initiative before his maneuvers are granted (beyond the initial one). At the end of each of his combat turns, one previously withheld maneuver (randomly determined) is granted to him, and thus becomes accessible for his next turn and subsequent turns. He can freely choose to initiate any maneuver that is currently granted when his turn begins, but he cannot initiate a withheld maneuver. If the warpath follower chooses not to employ a maneuver in a given round, his currently granted maneuvers remain available, and a previously withheld maneuver is granted, as described above. In other words, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if he uses his maneuvers or not&mdash;at the end of each of his turns, one withheld maneuver from his selection of readied maneuvers is granted to him. Over the course of a few rounds, all the warpath follower&rsquo;s maneuvers will eventually be granted.</p>\n<p>A warpath follower can change the readied maneuvers he has chosen to be immediately granted for use at any time by spending one minute in prayer.</p>\n<p>If, at the end of the warpath follower&rsquo;s turn, he cannot be granted a maneuver because he has no withheld maneuvers remaining, he recovers all expended maneuvers, and a new group of readied maneuvers is granted to him, replacing his previously granted maneuvers if any remain unspent. He selects one of his choice and gains the remainder of granted maneuvers as randomized selections, as noted below. At the end of his next turn, a withheld maneuver is granted to the warpath follower, and the process of inspiration begins again.</p>\n<p>At 4th level and again at 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the number of maneuvers granted to the warpath follower at the beginning of an encounter and when he recovers his maneuvers increases by one. Unlike the warpath follower&rsquo;s initial granted maneuver, these additional maneuvers are randomly determined (for example, at the beginning of an encounter, a 4th level warpath follower would choose one maneuver to have access to, then randomly be granted one more).</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a warpath follower can speak a brief prayer, recovering a single expended maneuver as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>.

Enemies within 30 feet that can perceive the rubato&rsquo;s performance must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;save (DC 10 + 1/2 the rubato&rsquo;s class level + his rubato initiation modifier) or take a &ndash;1 penalty on all non-damage rolls made as part of their attacks or strikes while the rubato maintains this performance. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same rubato&rsquo;s dissonance performance until the end of the encounter. This penalty increases by &ndash;1 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. This ability replaces&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Fascinate-Su-\">fascinate</a>.</p>\n<p>Fortissimo (Su): At 6th level, a rubato learns to empower his maneuvers with tempo. Unlike other bardic performances, he may&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Activate-Magic-Item\">activate</a>&nbsp;this performance while maintaining another performance. When the rubato initiates a strike with an initiation action of 1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, he can expend 3 rounds of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Bardic-Performance\">bardic performance</a>&nbsp;and 2 points of tempo to increase the damage (including ability damage, if appropriate) dealt by that strike by 50%. He can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Activate-Magic-Item\">activate</a>&nbsp;this performance after rolling his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;and determining if it hit or missed, but must activate it before damage is rolled. The rubato must wait 3 rounds after performing a fortissimo before he may perform it again. This ability replaces&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard/#TOC-Suggestion-Sp-\">suggestion</a>.</p>\n<p>Canon (Su): At 8th level, a rubato learns to lead his allies in a martial rhythm. An ally must be able to perceive the rubato&rsquo;s performance to be affected. Whenever an affected ally initiates a maneuver, they can recover an expended maneuver of different type (for example, an ally that initiates a strike may recover a boost or a counter). Each affected ally may only recover up to one maneuver per round in this fashion. This ability replaces&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Dirge-of-Doom-Su-\">dirge of doom</a>.</p>\n<p>Accelerando (Su): At 9th level, a rubato learns to charge his allies with his tempo, infusing them with the Primal Song. An ally must be able to perceive the rubato&rsquo;s performance to be affected. Affected allies gain the benefits of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste\">haste</a>&nbsp;spell. Starting and maintaining this performance costs two performance rounds for each round the rubato performs, rather than one. This ability replaces&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Inspire-Greatness-Su-\">inspire greatness</a>.</p>\n<p>Crescendo (Su): At 14th level, a rubato can maximize his strikes with tempo, smiting his enemies with the triumphant rise of the Primal Song. Unlike other bardic performances, he may activate this performance while maintaining another performance. When the rubato initiates a strike with an initiation action of 1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, he can expend 4 rounds of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Bardic-Performance\">bardic performance</a>&nbsp;and 4 points of tempo to maximize the damage (including ability damage, if appropriate) dealt by that strike. Treat all damage&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/toys-games-puzzles#TOC-Dice\">dice</a>&nbsp;rolled as part of the strike as though they had achieved the maximum result. This does not affect any other part of the strike, such as attack rolls or rolls to determine the duration of its effects. This ability replaces&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Frightening-Tune-Sp-\">frightening tune</a>.</p>\n<p>Harmonize (Su): At 15th level, a rubato learns to harmonize his allies&rsquo; movements with the rhythm of the Primal Song. Unlike other bardic performances, this performance costs 2 tempo per round to maintain rather than costing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Bardic-Performance\">bardic performance</a>&nbsp;rounds. An ally must be able to perceive the rubato&rsquo;s performance to be affected. Affected allies gain an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus\">insight bonus</a>&nbsp;equal to the rubato&rsquo;s initiation modifier to their AC, on saving throws, and on skill checks made as part of initiating maneuvers. This bonus increases by +2 during any round in which the rubato recovers one or more maneuvers. This ability replaces&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Inspire-Heroics-Su-\">inspire heroics</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Con</a>&nbsp;Moto (Su): At 18th level, a rubato gains the ability to enhance the maneuvers of his allies with his tempo. An ally must be able to perceive the rubato&rsquo;s performance to be affected. Whenever an affected ally initiates a maneuver, the rubato can spend 2 tempo as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, even if it isn&rsquo;t his turn. If he does, that ally may move up to 15 feet as part of the maneuver (resolve this movement either immediately before, or immediately after initiating the maneuver) or if the maneuver already involves movement, they may increase the distance moved by 15 feet. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, unless another ability would prevent such attacks. In addition, the save DC of that ally&rsquo;s maneuver (if any) increases by 2. This ability replaces&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard/#TOC-Mass-Suggestion-Sp-\">mass suggestion</a>.</p>\n<p>Fugue (Ex): At 20th level, the rubato learns to maintain two bardic performances at the same time. He can activate two bardic performances with the same action, paying any associated costs for each separately. Performances noted as being able to be used while maintaining other performances (such as fortissimo) do not count against this limit.
